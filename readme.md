# ABOUT 
This project is working in conjucture with a version of a C verison of [Darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet), using that for training and computer vision for the league of legends AI bot

My hope is that after training the computer vision part of it i will be able to have that transfer to in game actions after more training 

## What im currently working on:
- Good data
- training computer vision

## todo:
- add more items to recognise
- build/find neural net for output of computer vision -> input for game
- YOLO with multiple images? 
- update tidy up scripts
